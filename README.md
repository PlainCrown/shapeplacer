# Tetris

Basic clone of the classic tetris game with a few tweaks and additional features. Made in Godot 3.1.

# Project scope

The goal is to make a small game following the classic tetris formula while adding a few additional features to make it more unique and enjoyable than a direct copy of the original. This is a finished project that may have minor updates in the future.

# Missing features and contributions

Recommended features for contribution:
* Replace the block.gd script and block sprite sheet with custom colorization for each shape using the ColorPickerButton

Features that I plan to implement:
* .ico files for Windows icons

Do not work on the features that I plan to implement myself, I might have finished them already. Also do not add anything sound related to avoid issues with licensingâ€”if you'd like to suggest additional sound effects or sound tracks, post about it in the issues tab under the "Enhancements" label.
All other additions to the game are welcome, especially the recommended features mentioned above. Other valuable contributions include code optimization, improving comments, fixing and reporting issues in the issues tab.
